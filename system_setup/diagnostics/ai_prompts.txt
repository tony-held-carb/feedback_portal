github prompt:

I develop on multiple machines and ides and it gets a little confusing with all the settings and configuration options between setups.

here are my computers.

home machine: windows with admin
work machine: windows no admin
ec2: linux no admin

ides
pycharm
cursor
VS code

additional related apps setups
miniconda
git bash

bash setup files
.bashrc
.bash_profile

my development env is mini_conda_02

I would like to create a file called system_setups.md that is a reference for how my various computers and related software are configured, so i can try and have them somewhat consistent.

I am now on my work computer.  some diagnostic information about that computer is below.  Lets use that as a starting point for creating the system_setups.md file.  what other diagnostics would you like me to run so we can characterize this machine.  after we finish that we will explore how pycharm is set up and the location of any configuration files and settings related to that app.

commands that gpt requested for the mini anaconda shell:
conda info
conda list
conda env list

run the following from base and your dev env (mini_conda_02)
where python
python --version

my development env is mini_conda_02

where git
git --version
git config --list

set

commands that gpt requested for the power shell:
Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\* |
  Select-Object DisplayName, DisplayVersion | Sort-Object DisplayName

commands for git bash
set
cat ~/.bashrc
cat ~/.bash_profile
ls -la ~
cd ~
pwd

commands associated with the ide's and setup

note that cursor is installed, but won't run on my work machine because of work firewall/authorization issues.

Pycharm install related:
from the pycharm ide gui find out what version you are running

from the anaconda prompt:
where pycharm
type (the .bat file associated with the last response)
cd %APPDATA%\JetBrains
dir
cd PyCharm2025.1
dir
C:\Users\theld\
dir
type %USERPROFILE%\.condarc

from the git bash run
ls -la ~/bash_completion.d

zip and send the entire %APPDATA%\JetBrains\PyCharm2025.1 this was too big
.bat file did not work
cd /d "C:\tony_local\pycharm\feedback_portal\system_setup\"
pycharm_settings.bat

from powershell
cd \d "C:\tony_local\pycharm\feedback_portal\system_setup"
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
