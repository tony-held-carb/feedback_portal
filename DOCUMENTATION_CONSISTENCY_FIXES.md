docs: Fix chronological inconsistencies and phase ordering in refactor documentation

## Summary

Fixed date inconsistencies and reorganized phase descriptions in ascending order
to make the documentation complete and consistent.

## Changes Made

### 1. Chronological Fixes
- Corrected all date references from "January 2025" to "August 2025" 
- Updated completion dates across all documentation files
- Ensured consistent timeline throughout project documentation

### 2. Phase Ordering Reorganization
**Before**: Phases were presented out of order (7A, 6, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7A, 8)
**After**: Phases now in logical ascending order (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7A, 8)

#### Phase Sequence (Corrected):
- Phase 0: Helper Functions with Result Types (Foundation)
- Phase 1: Route Helper Functions (Common Components)
- Phase 2: Error Handling Helper Functions
- Phase 3: Success Handling Helper Functions
- Phase 4: Template Rendering Helper Functions
- Phase 5: Unified Diagnostics
- Phase 6: Result Types Module
- Phase 7A: Route Orchestration Framework
- Phase 8: Unified In-Memory Processing Architecture

### 3. Status Updates
- Updated current status to reflect Phase 8 completion
- Added critical bug fixes documentation (function signature errors)
- Updated final test results (781 unit + 145 E2E = 926 total tests)
- Added completion validation with 100% success rate

### 4. Files Updated
- `data_ingestion_refactor_current_state.md`
- `data_ingestion_refactor_roadmap.md`
- `data_ingestion_refactor_implementation_guide.md`

## Impact

- ✅ Chronologically consistent documentation
- ✅ Logical phase progression from foundation to completion
- ✅ Accurate reflection of August 2025 completion timeline
- ✅ Complete and consistent cross-document references
- ✅ Clear historical progression of systematic refactoring

The documentation now provides a coherent, chronologically accurate record
of the successful ARB Feedback Portal data ingestion refactor.
