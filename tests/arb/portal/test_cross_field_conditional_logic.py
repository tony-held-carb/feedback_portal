"""
Comprehensive Cross-Field and Conditional Logic Tests for ARB Feedback Portal.

This module tests complex form validation logic including:
- Contingent field visibility (fields that become required/optional based on other fields)
- Cross-field validation rules (business logic that enforces relationships between fields)  
- Conditional dropdown population (dropdowns that change based on other selections)
- Regulatory compliance logic (specific rules for different sectors)

Tests cover all major sectors:
- Oil & Gas (OGFeedback)
- Landfill (LandfillFeedback)
- Energy (EnergyFeedback)
- Dairy Digester (DairyDigesterFeedback)
- Generic (GenericFeedback)

Args:
  None

Returns:
  None

Attributes:
  logger (logging.Logger): Logger instance for this module

Examples:
  pytest tests/arb/portal/test_cross_field_conditional_logic.py -v
  pytest tests/arb/portal/test_cross_field_conditional_logic.py::test_oil_gas_venting_exclusion -v

Notes:
  - Uses mocks for Globals data to test complex form logic without requiring full Flask context
  - Tests both positive and negative scenarios for each conditional logic rule
  - Validates regulatory compliance requirements for each sector
  - Covers edge cases and error conditions
