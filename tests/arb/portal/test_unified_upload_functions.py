"""
Integration tests for Phase 8B unified upload processing functions.

This module provides comprehensive testing for the new unified upload functions
that leverage the in-memory staging architecture to eliminate code duplication.

Test Coverage:
- upload_and_process_file_unified: Direct upload using unified pipeline
- stage_uploaded_file_for_review_unified: Staged upload using unified pipeline
- Equivalence testing: Ensure unified functions match original behavior
- Error handling: Comprehensive error scenario testing
- Performance validation: Memory usage and processing efficiency

The tests demonstrate the architectural benefits:
- Single source of truth for processing logic
- Configuration-driven behavior validation
- Consistent error handling across upload types
- Perfect backward compatibility
