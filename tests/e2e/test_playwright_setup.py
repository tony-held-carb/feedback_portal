Playwright Setup Verification Script
===================================

This script provides a simple test to verify that your Playwright Python installation is working correctly.
It is intended for both beginners and advanced users who want to confirm that Playwright is installed and functional.

Purpose:
--------
- Ensure that Playwright and its Python bindings are correctly installed and configured.
- Verify that Playwright can launch a browser, navigate to a page, and interact with it.
- Provide a quick diagnostic before running more complex end-to-end (E2E) tests.

Typical Use Cases:
------------------
- After installing Playwright and its dependencies, to confirm the setup is correct.
- When troubleshooting E2E test failures that may be related to Playwright installation or environment issues.
- As a basic health check in CI/CD pipelines.

Prerequisites:
--------------
- Python 3.8+
- Playwright Python package installed (`pip install playwright`)
- Playwright browsers installed (`playwright install`)

Usage:
------
1. You do NOT need the Flask app or any local server running for this test.
2. Run this script directly:

    python tests/e2e/test_playwright_setup.py

   Or run as a pytest test:

    pytest tests/e2e/test_playwright_setup.py

3. The script will launch a headless Chromium browser, navigate to https://example.com, and check the page content.

Output:
-------
- Console output indicating the progress of the test.
- Success or failure message indicating whether Playwright is set up correctly.
