Comprehensive Unit Tests for Route Equivalence and Performance

This module provides fast, comprehensive unit testing that covers all the functionality
previously tested by slow E2E tests. It tests route equivalence, performance characteristics,
and business logic consistency without the overhead of browser automation.

Coverage includes:
1. Route equivalence testing (original vs refactored)
2. Performance comparison and validation
3. File processing logic equivalence
4. Error handling consistency
5. Database interaction validation
6. Response format consistency

This replaces the need for:
- test_refactored_routes_equivalence_optimized.py (E2E)
- test_refactored_routes_equivalence.py (E2E)
- test_upload_performance_comparison.py (E2E)
