This readme provides notes on what comments we have received on the various versions of the operator feedback forms.
There were several files floating around that were similarly named with asynchronous input that was a little confusing to follow.
This file sorts through what changes were made and tries to settle any version control issues.





* 1/8/25
	* Steve sent out the following feedback forms as email attachment for ARB commenting:
		* oil_and_gas_operator_feedback_v40.xlsx
		* landfill_operator_feedback_v40.xlsx
	* The email instructions ask users to modify the attached files and then submit feedback
* 1/9/25
	* Steve sent out an email with the operator spreadsheets on sharepoint for ARB commenting:
	* The sharepoint link is: 
		* https://carb.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/RDSatelliteProject/Shared%20Documents/General/RD-ED-ISD%20High-level%20Planning/Operator%20Notification%20Materials%20for%20Review?csf=1&web=1&e=q8uh4M

* 2/14/25
	* File version control
	* The sharepoint has a subfolder with previous versions
	* It is a little confusing since there were direct changes to the files and comments
	  that were not fully documented
	* I'm going from v40 to the current version of v52, v53 to make sure all the comments/changes were properly addressed

* It looks like the language was changed in the instructions by Linda/Quinn and the related issue tracker item 12 has a comment:
	Instruction #1 was not accurate so I fixed some of it. We need to add a line under #1 that states that if  Q8 applies, they need to inspect within 5 days and report within 72 hours of completing the inspection (8 days total).
