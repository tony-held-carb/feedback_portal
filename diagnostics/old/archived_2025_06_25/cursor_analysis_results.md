# Cursor Environment Analysis Results

## Current Configuration

### Git Configuration
- **User**: Tony Held (tony.held@gmail.com)
- **Credential Helper**: `manager` (Windows Credential Manager)
- **No existing GitHub tokens** stored in Git config

### Cursor Settings
- **Settings file**: Minimal configuration (only window.commandCenter and terminal profile)
- **No GitHub-specific settings** found in Cursor configuration
- **No GitHub extensions** currently installed/cached

## Recommended Approach for Work Computer

Since your work computer has the same setup, here's the most reliable method:

### Method 1: Windows Credential Manager (Recommended)

This leverages your existing `credential.helper=manager` configuration.

#### Step 1: Generate GitHub Token
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token with permissions:
   - `repo` (full control of private repositories)
   - `workflow` (update GitHub Action workflows)
3. Copy the token

#### Step 2: Add to Windows Credential Manager
1. Press `Win+R`, type `control keymgr.dll`, press Enter
2. Click "Windows Credentials" → "Add a generic credential"
3. Fill in:
   - **Internet or network address**: `git:https://github.com`
   - **User name**: `Tony Held` (or your GitHub username)
   - **Password**: paste your personal access token
4. Click "OK"

#### Step 3: Test the Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/test-repo.git
```
Should work without prompts.

### Method 2: Git Credential Store (Alternative)

If Windows Credential Manager doesn't work:

#### Step 1: Change Credential Helper
```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

#### Step 2: Trigger Token Storage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/test-repo.git
```
When prompted:
- Username: your GitHub username
- Password: paste your personal access token

### Method 3: Cursor Settings (If Available)

Since Cursor doesn't have GitHub-specific settings currently, you might need to:

1. Install GitHub extension in Cursor (if available)
2. Look for GitHub authentication settings
3. Enter username and token directly

## Why This Works

- **Windows Credential Manager** is already configured in your Git
- **No browser OAuth needed** - bypasses DNS restrictions
- **Persistent storage** - works until token expires
- **Same setup** - your work computer should have identical configuration

## Testing

After setting up the token, test with:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/test-repo.git
git push
git pull
```

All should work without browser prompts.

## Troubleshooting

If Cursor still tries browser auth:
1. Check Windows Credential Manager for the stored credential
2. Verify the credential address is exactly `git:https://github.com`
3. Try Method 2 (git credential store) instead
4. Check if there are conflicting credentials in Windows Credential Manager
