# Datetime Compliance Analysis â€“ July 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes the analyses and results of a comprehensive review to ensure that the ARB Feedback Portal codebase is fully datetime contract compliant.

---

## 1. What Was Checked
- **Routes and Helpers:**
  - All Flask routes in `routes.py` and their associated helper functions (e.g., `incidence_prep`, `model_to_wtform`, `wtform_to_model`, `dict_to_database`).
- **Database Models and Serialization:**
  - SQLAlchemy models and all code paths that read/write datetime values to the database or JSON columns.
- **Form Handling:**
  - WTForms definitions (`wtf_oil_and_gas.py`, `wtf_landfill.py`) and all code that populates or reads datetime values from forms.
- **Utility Functions:**
  - All functions in `utils/date_and_time.py` used for datetime conversion, validation, and serialization.
- **Test/Hardcoded Data:**
  - Dummy data functions in `db_hardcoded.py` and their usage in routes and tests.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Direct datetime assignments, Excel/HTML ingestion, and any code bypassing contract utilities.

---

## 2. Methods Used
- **Semantic and Regex Codebase Searches:**
  - Searched for all usages of `datetime`, `isoformat`, `fromisoformat`, `DateTimeLocalField`, and related keywords across the codebase.
- **File and Function Reviews:**
  - Read and traced logic in all relevant files, including routes, helpers, and utilities.
- **Contract Documentation Update:**
  - Refactored `date_time_data_contract.md` to reference only actual utility functions and provide clear, contract-compliant usage examples.
- **Edge Case Investigation:**
  - Checked for direct DB/test data writes, Excel/HTML ingestion, and any non-compliant patterns.

---

## 3. Key Findings
- **Database Compliance:**
  - All DB datetime columns are UTC-aware (`timezone=True`).
  - All serialization to JSON/DB uses ISO 8601 UTC strings via contract utilities.
- **Form Compliance:**
  - All WTForms datetime fields use `DateTimeLocalField` with the correct HTML5 format.
  - All form data is converted to/from UTC using contract utilities before DB interaction.
- **Utility Functions:**
  - All datetime conversions, validations, and serializations are centralized in `utils/date_and_time.py`.
- **Test/Hardcoded Data:**
  - Dummy data functions simulate form input (naive, local) and are not written directly to the DB.
  - Deprecated/unused DB dummy data functions were removed.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - No evidence of raw or naive datetimes being written to the DB or JSON columns.
  - No code bypasses contract utilities for datetime handling.
- **Documentation:**
  - The datetime contract doc is now concise, accurate, and references only implemented utilities.

---

## 4. Final Compliance Status
- **All code paths that read, write, or manipulate datetimes in the ARB Feedback Portal are contract compliant.**
- **No non-compliant patterns or edge cases remain.**
- **The codebase is ready for ongoing maintenance with clear, enforceable datetime handling standards.**

*For future changes, always update `utils/date_and_time.py` and the contract doc to maintain compliance.*
