# Data Ingestion Refactor Documentation

This directory contains the current roadmap and implementation guidance for the ARB Feedback Portal's spreadsheet upload data ingestion pipeline refactor.

## Purpose

The refactor aims to modernize and improve the reliability of the portal's file upload system by implementing better error handling, result types, and separation of concerns while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Current Documentation

### 1. `data_ingestion_refactor_current_state.md`
**Purpose**: Provides an accurate assessment of the current state of the data ingestion refactor.

**Contents**:
- Completed components (refactored routes, result types, staging implementation, error handling)
- Partially complete components (direct upload refactor)
- Architecture comparison between original and refactored approaches
- Function inventory and test coverage analysis
- Data flow diagrams and known issues
- Success metrics and performance benchmarks

**Use Case**: Understanding what has been accomplished and what remains to be done.

### 2. `data_ingestion_refactor_roadmap.md`
**Purpose**: Provides a clear, actionable roadmap for completing the data ingestion refactor.

**Contents**:
- Immediate next steps and priorities
- Phased implementation timeline (4 phases)
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Success metrics and monitoring approaches
- Implementation guidelines and best practices

**Use Case**: Planning and executing the remaining refactor work.

### 3. `data_ingestion_refactor_implementation_guide.md`
**Purpose**: Provides technical implementation guidance for developers working on the refactor.

**Contents**:
- Code patterns and standards (Result Type, Helper Function, Main Function patterns)
- Error handling standards and user-friendly messages
- Testing guidelines and migration strategies
- Performance considerations and benchmarking approaches

**Use Case**: Implementing new features or modifying existing refactored components.

## Key Concepts

- **Parallel Implementation**: Running original and refactored routes side-by-side for backward compatibility
- **Result Types**: Using named tuples (`UploadResult`, `StagingResult`) for rich error handling
- **Feature Flags**: Controlling the use of refactored implementations
- **Error Handling Standards**: Defined error types and user-friendly messages
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Measuring and comparing performance of original vs. refactored code
