# Diagnostics Dev Session Log â€” 2025-07-19

## What We Tried

- **Goal:** Robustly log JavaScript diagnostics for all key actions (including discard) on `/list_staged` and `/java_script_diagnostic_test` for both overlay and backend, and ensure E2E Playwright tests can verify this.
- Refactored diagnostics system to use `.js-log-btn` and `data-js-logging-context` for all loggable buttons (diagnostics, discard, review, upload, etc.).
- Updated all relevant HTML templates and Playwright E2E tests to use the new system.
- Implemented a simple intercept/log/submit approach for discard buttons: prevent default, log, then submit form after a short delay.
- Ran E2E tests repeatedly to verify overlay and backend logging for all actions.

## What Worked

- Diagnostics overlay and backend logging work perfectly for non-destructive actions (diagnostics send, review, upload, etc.).
- E2E tests for diagnostics overlay on `/java_script_diagnostic_test` and `/list_staged` (send button) pass and confirm overlay updates as expected.
- Discard button logs are sent to backend (confirmed in logs) before form submission.

## What Failed / Limitations

- Overlay log for discard action is **not visible after the action** because the form submission causes a full page reload, clearing the overlay before Playwright can read it.
- E2E test for overlay-after-discard fails, as expected, due to this limitation.
- Simple intercept/log/submit approach is not sufficient for overlay persistence across destructive actions.

## Proposed Next Steps

1. **Move to AJAX/fetch-based discard:**
   - Prevent default form submission for discard.
   - Use JavaScript (fetch) to POST the discard request.
   - On success, update the overlay and UI without reloading the page.
   - This will allow diagnostics logs to persist and be testable after discard actions.
2. **(Optional) Adjust E2E tests:**
   - If AJAX is not immediately feasible, consider checking backend logs for discard actions in tests as a temporary workaround.
3. **Review and refactor:**
   - Ensure all diagnostics actions (including modals, errors, etc.) are consistently logged.
   - Clean up any legacy code or selectors.

**Ready to continue tomorrow with AJAX discard implementation or further diagnostics improvements!**
