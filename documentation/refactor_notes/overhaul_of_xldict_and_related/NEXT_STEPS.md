# Next Steps - Action Plan & Implementation Guide

## 📋 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**Current Status**: 70% Complete, Blocked on Core Logic Extraction  
**Critical Blocker**: `upload_logic.py` contains only placeholder functions  
**Next Priority**: Extract business logic from routes.py to complete Phase 8  
**Timeline**: 3 weeks to complete the refactor  
**Risk Level**: Low (excellent testing infrastructure, 1132 tests passing)

---

## 🎯 **Immediate Action Plan**

### **Phase 1: Complete Core Logic Extraction** 🔴 **CRITICAL PRIORITY**

This is the **critical blocker** preventing completion of the unified architecture and achievement of the 75% code deduplication target.

#### **What Needs to Happen**
1. **Extract Direct Upload Logic**: Move business logic from `upload_file()` route to `upload_file_logic()`
2. **Extract Staged Upload Logic**: Move business logic from `upload_file_staged()` route to `upload_file_staged_logic()`
3. **Extract Refactored Route Logic**: Move business logic from refactored routes to their corresponding logic functions
4. **Implement Proper Error Handling**: Replace placeholder error handling with actual business logic error handling
5. **Create Comprehensive Tests**: Test extracted logic functions independently

#### **Why This is Critical**
- The `upload_logic.py` file contains **ONLY PLACEHOLDER FUNCTIONS** with TODO comments
- This is blocking the completion of the unified architecture
- Without this, we cannot achieve the 75% code deduplication target
- The refactor is 70% complete but cannot progress without this step

#### **Day 1-2: Extract Direct Upload Logic**
**Target**: Extract logic from `upload_file()` route to `upload_file_logic()`

**Current Route Logic** (in `routes.py`):
```python
@main.route('/upload', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def upload_file(message: str | None = None):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        try:
            request_file = request.files.get('file')
            if not request_file or not request_file.filename:
                return render_template('upload.html', form=form, 
                                   upload_message="No file selected. Please choose a file.")
            
            # Step 1: Save file and attempt DB ingest
            file_path, id_, sector = uploadand_update_db(db, upload_folder, request_file, base)
            
            if id_:
                return redirect(url_for('main.incidence_update', id_=id_))
            
            # Handle missing id_incidence case
            if file_path and (file_path.exists() if hasattr(file_path, 'exists') else True):
                return render_template('upload.html', form=form,
                                   upload_message="This file is missing a valid 'Incidence/Emission ID'...")
            
            # Handle schema recognition failure
            error_details = generate_upload_diagnostics(request_file, file_path)
            detailed_message = format_diagnostic_message(error_details, "Uploaded file format not recognized.")
            return render_template('upload.html', form=form, upload_message=detailed_message)

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **Testing Requirements for Core Logic Extraction**

#### **Step 1: Test Extracted Logic Functions**
Create comprehensive tests for each extracted logic function:

```python
def test_upload_file_logic_success():
    """Test successful file upload logic."""
    # Test successful upload case
    
def test_upload_file_logic_missing_id():
    """Test upload logic with missing ID."""
    # Test missing ID case
    
def test_upload_file_logic_conversion_failed():
    """Test upload logic with conversion failure."""
    # Test conversion failure case
    
def test_upload_file_logic_exception():
    """Test upload logic with exception."""
    # Test exception handling case
```

#### **Step 2: Test Route Integration**
Ensure routes continue to work with extracted logic:

```python
def test_upload_file_route_with_extracted_logic():
    """Test that upload_file route works with extracted logic."""
    # Test route integration
    
def test_upload_file_staged_route_with_extracted_logic():
    """Test that upload_file_staged route works with extracted logic."""
    # Test route integration
```

#### **Step 3: Test Route Equivalence**
Ensure route equivalence tests continue to pass:

```python
def test_route_equivalence_with_extracted_logic():
    """Test that route equivalence is maintained after logic extraction."""
    # Test route equivalence
```

### **Current Test Status**
- **Total Tests**: 1156 collected

## 📊 **Summary**

The refactor has **excellent foundations** with comprehensive testing, helper functions, and route structure, but **CRITICAL COMPONENTS REMAIN INCOMPLETE**:

- ✅ **Testing Infrastructure**: 1132 tests passing demonstrates robust foundation
- ✅ **Helper Functions**: Comprehensive set of route helpers implemented
- ✅ **Route Structure**: Multiple parallel implementations provide good foundation
- 🔴 **Core Logic Extraction**: **CRITICAL GAP** - upload_logic.py contains only placeholders
- 🔴 **Unified Architecture**: **NOT ACHIEVED** due to incomplete core logic extraction

**Next Priority**: Complete Phase 8 (Core Logic Extraction) to unblock the unified architecture completion and achieve the 75% code deduplication target.

**This is a focused, achievable task that will unlock the unified architecture and complete the refactor successfully.**
