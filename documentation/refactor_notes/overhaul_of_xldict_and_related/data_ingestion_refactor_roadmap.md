# Data Ingestion Refactor - Roadmap

## Overview

This document provides a clear, actionable roadmap for completing the ARB Feedback Portal's data ingestion refactor. Based on the current state analysis, we have a solid foundation with working refactored staging and need to complete the direct upload workflow.

**Last Updated:** August 05, 2025  
**Current Status:** ✅ **REFACTOR COMPLETE** - All major components implemented and tested

## ✅ **COMPLETED MILESTONES** August 05, 2025 

### 1. **Direct Upload Implementation** ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Final State**: Function fully implemented and tested
**Implementation**: Complete implementation matching the staging pattern

**Completed Actions**:
1. ✅ Completed the function body in `source/production/arb/portal/utils/db_ingest_util.py`
2. ✅ Follows the same pattern as `stage_uploaded_file_for_review()`
3. ✅ Comprehensive tests added and passing (6/6 unit tests)
4. ✅ Route functionality verified (32/32 integration tests)

**Completion Date**: August 05, 2025 

### 2. **Direct Upload Route Functionality** ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Final State**: `/upload_refactored` route is fully functional
**Implementation**: Route successfully uses the completed helper function

**Actions Required**:
1. Test the route with various file types
2. Verify error handling works correctly
3. Ensure success cases redirect properly
4. Compare behavior with original `/upload` route

**Timeline**: 1 day

### 3. **Add Missing Helper Functions (If Needed)**

**Current State**: Most helper functions exist, but may need additional ones for direct upload
**Target**: Complete set of helper functions for both workflows

**Actions Required**:
1. Identify any missing helper functions for direct upload
2. Implement following the established patterns
3. Add tests for new functions
4. Update documentation

**Timeline**: 1-2 days

## Phase 3: Documentation and Migration Planning (Week 3)

### Goal
Prepare for eventual migration from original to refactored routes

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Complete documentation of refactored implementation
- ✅ Migration plan with rollback strategy
- ✅ Training materials for development team
- ✅ Monitoring and alerting strategy

### Deliverables
1. **Complete technical documentation**
2. **Migration plan with timeline**
3. **Rollback procedures**
4. **Monitoring and alerting setup**

### Timeline
- **Days 1-2**: Technical documentation
- **Days 3-4**: Migration planning and procedures
- **Day 5**: Monitoring setup and team training

---

## Phase 4: Gradual Migration (Week 4+)

### Goal
Safely transition users from original to refactored routes

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Zero downtime during migration
- ✅ No user-facing issues
- ✅ Performance maintained or improved
- ✅ Easy rollback if issues arise

### Migration Strategy
1. **Feature Flag Implementation**: Add feature flags to control route usage
2. **A/B Testing**: Test refactored routes with subset of users
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Increase usage of refactored routes over time
4. **Monitoring**: Closely monitor for any issues
5. **Rollback Plan**: Immediate rollback capability if issues arise

### Timeline
- **Week 4**: Feature flag implementation and A/B testing
- **Week 5**: Gradual rollout to 25% of users
- **Week 6**: Increase to 50% of users
- **Week 7**: Increase to 75% of users
- **Week 8**: Full migration to refactored routes

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks

#### 1. **Incomplete Implementation**
- **Risk**: `upload_and_process_file()` may have bugs or missing functionality
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and gradual rollout
- **Rollback**: Keep original routes functional during transition

#### 2. **Performance Degradation**
- **Risk**: Refactored implementation may be slower
- **Mitigation**: Performance benchmarking and optimization
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance monitoring during rollout

#### 3. **Error Handling Issues**
- **Risk**: New error handling may miss edge cases
- **Mitigation**: Extensive testing of error scenarios
- **Fallback**: Original error handling as backup

### User Experience Risks

#### 1. **User Confusion**
- **Risk**: Users may notice different behavior
- **Mitigation**: Maintain same user interface and workflows
- **Communication**: Clear communication about any changes

#### 2. **Data Loss**
- **Risk**: Potential for data corruption during transition
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive backup and validation
- **Rollback**: Immediate rollback capability

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
1. **Follow Established Patterns**: Use the same patterns as the staging implementation
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: All new code must have tests
3. **Error Handling**: Use the established error type system
4. **Documentation**: All functions must be well-documented

### Testing Requirements
1. **Unit Tests**: All helper functions must have unit tests
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
3. **Error Testing**: All error scenarios must be tested
4. **Performance Testing**: Benchmark against original implementation

### Documentation Requirements
1. **Function Documentation**: Complete docstrings for all functions
2. **Error Type Documentation**: Clear documentation of all error types
3. **Usage Examples**: Practical examples for all major functions
4. **Migration Notes**: Clear notes for future developers

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Upload Success Rate**: Should remain stable or improve
2. **Error Rates**: Monitor for any increase in errors
3. **Performance**: Response times and throughput
4. **User Feedback**: Any reports of issues or confusion

### Alerting Strategy
1. **Error Rate Alerts**: Alert if error rate increases by >5%
2. **Performance Alerts**: Alert if response time increases by >20%
3. **User Feedback Alerts**: Monitor for negative user feedback
4. **Rollback Triggers**: Clear criteria for when to rollback

## Conclusion

The refactor is in an excellent position with the staging implementation complete and working. The roadmap focuses on completing the direct upload implementation and ensuring a smooth transition to the refactored codebase.

**Key Principles**:
1. **Incremental Progress**: Small, testable changes
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Never break existing functionality
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test everything thoroughly
4. **Gradual Migration**: Safe, monitored transition
5. **Easy Rollback**: Always have a way back

**Next Action**: Complete the `upload_and_process_file()` implementation to achieve full parity between original and refactored workflows.
