Playwright Testing Utility Functions
===================================

General-purpose Playwright helpers for robust testing of file upload workflows in web applications.

These functions help ensure that file uploads are handled and verified reliably without using
fragile time-based waits like `page.wait_for_timeout(...)`. Instead, they detect visible feedback
messages in the DOM to confirm whether an upload succeeded, failed, or was rejected.

Part of the arb.portal.utils package for general-purpose testing utilities.

The current helper functions assume that the file upload does not change the route 
(i.e., the browser stays on the same page) after the upload process.

If the upload triggers a redirect, page reload, or navigation, then a different approach is needed.

Why Feedback-Based Upload Verification?
---------------------------------------
In typical file upload interfaces, the application provides **visible feedback** after upload ‚Äî
either a success alert (e.g., green `.alert-success`), error message (e.g., red `.alert-danger`),
or custom warning/validation indicator. This visual feedback is a natural, stable, and
user-facing signal that the app has processed the file.

Rather than waiting a fixed amount of time (which is slow and unreliable), these helpers:

  ‚úÖ Clear old/stale alerts that could interfere with test logic  
  ‚úÖ Perform the file upload  
  ‚úÖ Wait for any *new, visible feedback element* to appear (success, warning, or error)  

This ensures your test waits *only as long as necessary* ‚Äî and not longer ‚Äî while also
avoiding false positives from previous test state.

Avoids Common Pitfalls:
------------------------
- ‚ùå `wait_for_timeout(...)`: introduces flakiness, adds delay even when the app is ready.
- ‚ùå Checking only for presence of alerts (`locator.count() > 0`): may match stale messages.
- ‚ùå `wait_for_load_state("networkidle")`: does not apply to DOM-driven upload feedback.

Limitations:
------------
This pattern assumes that:
  - The app always provides visual feedback in response to a file upload.
  - Feedback messages are placed in the DOM under consistent class selectors.
  - Old alerts can be safely removed without impacting state.

It does *not* handle:
  - Silent backend failures with no frontend signal
  - File parsing logic that delays feedback indefinitely
  - AJAX-only flows where feedback appears in a modal, toast, or separate route

Usage:
-------
Recommended in all file upload tests where UI feedback is displayed using alerts or error messages.

Typical usage flow:

    clear_upload_feedback_alerts(page)
    upload_file_and_wait_for_feedback(page, "invalid_file.txt")
    expect(page.locator(".alert-danger")).to_contain_text("Only .xlsx files are allowed")

These helpers are compatible with Bootstrap-style alerts and can be extended to support modals,
toasts, or custom feedback containers if needed.
