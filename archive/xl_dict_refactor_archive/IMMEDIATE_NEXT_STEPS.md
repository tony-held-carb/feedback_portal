# Immediate Next Steps - Complete the Upload Refactor

## 🚨 **CRITICAL BLOCKER IDENTIFIED**

The refactor is **70% complete** with excellent foundations, but **CRITICAL COMPONENTS REMAIN INCOMPLETE**.

**Current Status**: `upload_logic.py` contains only placeholder functions with TODO comments
**Impact**: This is blocking the completion of the unified architecture and the achievement of the 75% code deduplication target

---

## 📊 **What's Already Complete** ✅

### **Excellent Foundation (100% Complete)**
- **Testing Infrastructure**: 1132 tests passing with comprehensive coverage
- **Route Helper Functions**: Error handling, success handling, template rendering
- **Result Types**: Comprehensive type-safe error handling throughout
- **Route Structure**: Multiple parallel implementations working correctly
- **Orchestration Framework**: Framework exists but not fully utilized

### **What's Working Right Now**
- All 6 upload routes are functional and tested
- Backend processing functions are working correctly
- Helper functions eliminate duplication at the route level
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability

## 🔴 **What's Blocking Completion**

### **Core Logic Extraction - INCOMPLETE**
**File**: `source/production/arb/portal/upload_logic.py`
**Status**: Contains only placeholder functions with TODO comments

```python
def upload_file_logic(file_path: Path) -> UploadLogicResult:
    # TODO: Extract actual logic from routes.py upload_file function
    # For now, return a placeholder result
    return UploadLogicResult(...)

def upload_file_staged_logic(file_path: Path) -> UploadLogicResult:
    # TODO: Extract actual logic from routes.py upload_file_staged function
    # For now, return a placeholder result
    return UploadLogicResult(...)
```

**Required**: Extract actual business logic from routes.py into these functions

## 🎯 **Immediate Action Plan**

### **Phase 1: Complete Core Logic Extraction** 🔴 **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**

#### **Step 1: Extract Direct Upload Logic**
**Target**: Extract logic from `upload_file()` route to `upload_file_logic()`

**Current Route Logic** (in `routes.py`):
```python
@main.route('/upload', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def upload_file(message: str | None = None):
    # ... setup code ...
    
    if request.method == 'POST':
        try:
            request_file = request.files.get('file')
            if not request_file or not request_file.filename:
                return render_template('upload.html', form=form, 
                                   upload_message="No file selected. Please choose a file.")
            
            # Step 1: Save file and attempt DB ingest
            file_path, id_, sector = uploadand_update_db(db, upload_folder, request_file, base)
            
            if id_:
                return redirect(url_for('main.incidence_update', id_=id_))
            
            # Handle missing id_incidence case
            if file_path and (file_path.exists() if hasattr(file_path, 'exists') else True):
                return render_template('upload.html', form=form,
                                   upload_message="This file is missing a valid 'Incidence/Emission ID'...")
            
            # Handle schema recognition failure
            error_details = generate_upload_diagnostics(request_file, file_path)
            detailed_message = format_diagnostic_message(error_details, "Uploaded file format not recognized.")
            return render_template('upload.html', form=form, upload_message=detailed_message)
            
        except Exception as e:
            # ... error handling ...
```

**Required Extraction**:
```python
def upload_file_logic(file_path: Path, request_file, db, upload_folder, base) -> UploadLogicResult:
    """
    Core logic for uploading a file (extracted from upload_file route).

    try:
        # Step 1: Save file and attempt DB ingest
        file_path, id_, sector = uploadand_update_db(db, upload_folder, request_file, base)
        
        if id_:
            return UploadLogicResult(
                success=True,
                status_code=200,
                flash_messages=["File uploaded successfully"],
                redirect_url=url_for('main.incidence_update', id_=id_),
                validation_errors=None,

            )
        
        # Handle schema recognition failure
        error_details = generate_upload_diagnostics(request_file, file_path)
        detailed_message = format_diagnostic_message(error_details, "Uploaded file format not recognized.")
        
        return UploadLogicResult(
            success=False,

            validation_errors={"error": str(e)},
            processed_data=None,
            error_message=str(e)
        )
```

#### **Step 2: Extract Staged Upload Logic**
**Target**: Extract logic from `upload_file_staged()` route to `upload_file_staged_logic()`

**Required Extraction**:
```python
def upload_file_staged_logic(file_path: Path, request_file, db, upload_folder, base) -> UploadLogicResult:
    """
    Core logic for staging a file for review (extracted from upload_file_staged route).

        db: Database session
        upload_folder: Upload directory path
        base: Database base
        
    Returns:
        UploadLogicResult with the result of the staging operation
    """
    try:
        # Save and stage (no DB commit)
        file_path, id_, sector, json_data, staged_filename = uploadand_stage_only(db, upload_folder, request_file, base)
        
        if id_ and staged_filename:
            return UploadLogicResult(
                success=True,
                status_code=200,
                flash_messages=["File staged successfully"],
                redirect_url=url_for('main.review_staged', id_=id_, filename=staged_filename),
                validation_errors=None,
                processed_data={"id": id_, "sector": sector, "staged_filename": staged_filename}
            )
        
        # Handle missing id_incidence case
        if file_path and (file_path.exists() if hasattr(file_path, 'exists') else True):

            status_code=400,
            flash_messages=["Staging failed"],
            redirect_url=None,
            validation_errors={"conversion_failed": "File format not recognized"},
            processed_data=None,
            error_message="This file is missing a valid 'Incidence/Emission ID' (id_incidence). Please verify the spreadsheet includes that field and try again."
        )
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception("Exception occurred during staged upload.")

            processed_data=None,
            error_message=str(e)
        )
```

#### **Step 3: Extract Refactored Route Logic**
**Target**: Extract logic from refactored routes to their corresponding logic functions

**Required Extraction**:
- `upload_file_refactored_logic()` - Extract from `upload_file_refactored()` route
- `upload_file_staged_refactored_logic()` - Extract from `upload_file_staged_refactored()` route

---

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **Step 1: Test Extracted Logic Functions**
Create comprehensive tests for each extracted logic function:

```python
def test_upload_file_logic_success():
    """Test successful file upload logic."""
    # Test successful upload case
    
def test_upload_file_logic_missing_id():
    """Test upload logic with missing ID."""
    # Test missing ID case
    
def test_upload_file_logic_conversion_failed():
    """Test upload logic with conversion failure."""
    # Test conversion failure case
    
def test_upload_file_logic_exception():
    """Test upload logic with exception."""
    # Test exception handling case
```

### **Step 2: Test Route Integration**
Ensure routes continue to work with extracted logic:

```python
def test_upload_file_route_with_extracted_logic():
    """Test that upload_file route works with extracted logic."""
    # Test route integration
    
def test_upload_file_staged_route_with_extracted_logic():
    """Test that upload_file_staged route works with extracted logic."""
    # Test route integration
```

### **Step 3: Test Route Equivalence**
Ensure route equivalence tests continue to pass:

```python
def test_route_equivalence_with_extracted_logic():
    """Test that route equivalence is maintained after logic extraction."""
    # Test route equivalence
```
