# Data Ingestion Refactor - Roadmap

## Overview

This document provides a clear, actionable roadmap for completing the ARB Feedback Portal's data ingestion refactor.
Based on the current state analysis, we have a solid foundation with working refactored staging and need to complete the
core logic extraction and unified processing pipeline.

**Last Updated:** August 2025
**Current Status:** 🔄 **PHASE 8 INCOMPLETE** - Core logic extraction blocking unified architecture completion

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL BLOCKER IDENTIFIED**

### **Core Logic Extraction - INCOMPLETE** 🔴 **BLOCKING COMPLETION**

The `source/production/arb/portal/upload_logic.py` file contains **ONLY PLACEHOLDER FUNCTIONS** with TODO comments:

```python
def upload_file_logic(file_path: Path) -> UploadLogicResult:
    # TODO: Extract actual logic from routes.py upload_file function
    # For now, return a placeholder result
    return UploadLogicResult(...)
```

**Impact**: This critical gap is preventing the completion of the unified architecture and the achievement of the 75% code deduplication target.

## 📋 **Conclusion**

The ARB Feedback Portal Data Ingestion refactor has **excellent foundations** with comprehensive testing, helper functions, and route structure. However, **critical components remain incomplete**:

- ✅ **Testing Infrastructure**: 1132 tests passing demonstrates robust foundation
- ✅ **Helper Functions**: Comprehensive set of route helpers implemented
- ✅ **Route Structure**: Multiple parallel implementations provide good foundation
- 🔴 **Core Logic Extraction**: **CRITICAL GAP** - upload_logic.py contains only placeholders
- 🔴 **Unified Architecture**: **NOT ACHIEVED** due to incomplete core logic extraction

**Next Priority**: Complete Phase 8 (Core Logic Extraction) to unblock the unified architecture completion and achieve the 75% code deduplication target.

**The refactor is 70% complete with excellent foundations but requires completion of core logic extraction to achieve its architectural goals.**
