Ideas on potential refactor

I am concerned that the refactoring my dict_to_database and related routes will make my brittle code break and could
result in a new structure that i don't understand.

notes_on_refactor.md will serve to document ideas to safely and refactor the code to make it more robust, maintainable, and extendable.

Let start by considering the upload_file_staged route as it is one of the main ways that spreadsheet feedback
is injested into the database.

the route is defined as:
def upload_file_staged(message: str | None = None) -> Union[str, Response]:

and the key file processing/parsing appears to be acheived by:

file_path, id_, sector, json_data, staged_filename = upload_and_stage_only(db, upload_folder, request_file, base)

once you have reviewed these documents let me know and we will continue our analysis
