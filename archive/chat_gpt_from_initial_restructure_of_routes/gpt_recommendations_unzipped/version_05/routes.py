"""
Blueprint-based routes for the main application.

This file contains all route definitions originally in app.py,
migrated to a Flask Blueprint for modularity.

Routes are attached to the 'main' Blueprint.

Notes:
    * All prior documentation, TODOs, and inline comments are retained.
    * Requires that create_app() in app.py registers this blueprint.
