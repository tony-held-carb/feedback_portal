Defines WTForms that can be used to simplify HTML form creation and validation
for the Oil & Gas and Landfill feedback workflows.

This module defines forms derived from FlaskForm. They are used in conjunction
with templates to render sector-specific feedback forms with conditional logic
and validators based on user inputs.

General-purpose WTForms utilities are located in:
    arb.utils.wtf_forms_util.py

Form classes:
    - OGFeedback: Oil & Gas sector form with conditional validation for venting,
      OGI/Method 21 logic, and equipment/component descriptions.
    - LandfillFeedback: Landfill sector form with contingent dropdowns, dynamic
      validation rules, and optional monitoring logic.

Each form includes:
    - Rich WTForms field definitions
    - Conditional validators depending on other fields
    - Custom validate() methods
    - Dynamic dropdown logic through determine_contingent_fields()

Example usage in Flask route:
    >>> form = OGFeedback()
    >>> if form.validate_on_submit():
    >>>     save_to_db(form.data)

def run_diagnostics():
    """
    Run diagnostics on OGFeedback and LandfillFeedback forms.

    This function simulates common workflows and exercises dynamic logic,
    validators, and selector dependencies in both forms.

    Intended for development use only.
