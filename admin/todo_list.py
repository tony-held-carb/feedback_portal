# todo - next steps
"""
* make updates from C:\Users\theld\OneDrive - California Air Resources Board\OneDriveLinks\Data Management Plan\Operator Portal\operator_portal_feature_requests_010.xlsm
  * Start with Portal UI/UX Requests
* 	Change 'not a citation' to 'not an enforcement action' - hmmm, i can't remember the context of this, so hunt around for these words

# code refactor to move file handling out of app.py

creating gpt_recommendations_02 because i may have put some bugs into gpt_recommendations_01.
I abandoned v01, i worked on v02, but i think it would be safe to get the stable portal on the ec2
before doing any major code re-works.

feedback portal now a clean repo, need to test that it still works on laptop,
then make it generalizable to the ec2

* probably want to disable the ability to delete an incidence
* ask dan for access to new db instance.

* Probably want to have a form passes validation modal after you validate.  Maybe stay on same page?

* Created new branch to update how selectors are created

Forget me nots
