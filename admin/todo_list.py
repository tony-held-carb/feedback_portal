chatgpt request template
----------------------------
I would like ***

1) app.py current has all the routes, please create a file named routes.py that has all routes associated with this project
2) in the routes file, use a blueprinting system where all the routes will use a newly created 'main' route
3) app.py should create a code factory app that is called in a separate wsgi file to make the app more portable.

Please refactor the following python code using the following style preferences:
1) use google docstrings with modern type hinting in the docstrings.
2) Include extensive documentation and examples.
3) Review all of the code and provide all suggestions in one response, not incrementally prompting me for additional information.
4) Include the full text for any file you create or propose to change.
5) Retain, all previous documentation, notes, and todos where possible
6) do not import typing, rather use modern type hinting such as the | symbol
7) do not omit any code for brevity, i'm going to copy paste your code into a new file.



Please create a new function named run_diagnostics that includes testing of key features of this file.

Please provide the complete updated source code for this file after the creation of run_diagnostics

Please refactor this Python file in one step, not incrementally. Return the entire file with Google-style docstrings, modern type hints (in docstrings), full documentation, and preserve all logic. Do not omit or summarize any portion

# todo - next steps
Next steps
----------------------------
* files that still need gpt refactor:
* app_util.py <-- started but resume here
* routes.py
* wtf_forms.py  <-- consider re-running chatgpt here, it sorta phoned it in :)

* app.py and config.py updated, app_util.py was not updated because it fail gpt refactor

* make updates from C:\Users\theld\OneDrive - California Air Resources Board\OneDriveLinks\Data Management Plan\Operator Portal\operator_portal_feature_requests_010.xlsm
  * Start with Portal UI/UX Requests
  *  Change 'not a citation' to 'not an enforcement action' - hmmm, I can't remember the context of this, so hunt around for these words

* code refactor to move file handling out of routes?

* probably want to disable the ability to delete an incidence
* ask dan for access to new db instance.

* Probably want to have a form passes validation modal after you validate.  Maybe stay on same page?

* preparing to use ChatGPT to restructure code

Forget me nots
----------------------------
1.  I asked chat gpt to make restructure the first time and did not accept them because their were mistakes
and i was confused, there was some pretty interesting request preprocessing that I would like to revisit
as I don't know how to do that and it seemed very powerful.  Try to revisit
