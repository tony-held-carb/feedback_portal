# mini_conda_02.yml

# based off original mini_conda_01.yml that was last modified 2025-06-09.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
# --------
#   - Requirements file for the creation of the conda environment suitable for flask web development
#
# Creating the virtual environment:
# ---------------------------------
#   - Shell commands to create conda virtual environment named "mini_conda_02"
#
#       conda update conda
#       conda env list
#       conda remove --name mini_conda_02 --all
#       conda deactivate
#
#     on home computer:
#         conda env create -f "D:\local\cursor\feedback_portal\admin\mini_conda_02.yml"
#     on work laptop:
#         conda env create -f "C:\tony_local\pycharm\feedback_portal\admin\mini_conda_02.yml"
#     on ec2:
#         conda env create -f "/home/theld/code/git_repos/feedback_portal/admin/mini_conda_02.yml"
#
# Updating the conda environment:
# ------------------------------
#   - Shell commands to update the conda virtual environment named "mini_conda_02"
#
#     conda activate mini_conda_02  (Warning! Make sure you don't skip this activation step)
#
#     on home computer:
#         conda env update --file "D:\local\cursor\feedback_portal\admin\mini_conda_02.yml" --prune
#     on work laptop:
#         conda env update --file "C:\tony_local\pycharm\feedback_portal\admin\mini_conda_02.yml"
#     on ec2:
#         conda env update --file "/home/theld/code/git_repos/feedback_portal/admin/mini_conda_02.yml"

# Notes:
# ------
#   - Make sure the name field below "name: mini_conda_02" matches the file name to avoid namespace issues
#
# Playwright Install Notes:
# ------
#   - After creating or updating this environment, on work/home machines run:
#         playwright install
#   - on EC2, run:
#         playwright install --with-deps
#     This downloads the required browser binaries for Playwright-based tests.
#     If you skip this step, all Playwright/pytest-playwright tests will fail with browser not found errors.
#
# EC2 Playwright Installation Options (try in order):
# --------------------------------------------------
# Option 1: Force Playwright to use conda's Node.js
#   export PLAYWRIGHT_NODEJS_PATH=~/miniconda3/envs/mini_conda_02/bin/node
#   playwright install --with-deps
#
# Option 2: Install only Firefox (more compatible with older systems)
#   playwright install firefox
#
# Option 3: Reinstall Playwright with system dependencies
#   pip uninstall playwright
#   pip install playwright[system-deps]
#   playwright install --with-deps
#
# Option 4: Use older Playwright version (more compatible)
#   pip uninstall playwright
#   pip install playwright==1.40.0
#   playwright install --with-deps
#
# If all options fail, the environment will still work for all other functionality.
# Only E2E tests will be affected - unit and integration tests will work normally.
