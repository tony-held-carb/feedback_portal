# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
# --------
#   - Requirements file for the creation of the conda environment suitable for flask web development
#
# Creating the virtual environment:
# ---------------------------------
#   - Shell commands to create conda virtual environment named "mini_conda_02"
#
#       conda update conda
#       conda env list
#       conda remove --name mini_conda_02 --all
#       conda deactivate
#
#     on home computer:
#         conda env create -f "D:\local\cursor\feedback_portal\admin\mini_conda_02.yml"
#     on work laptop:
#         conda env create -f "C:\tony_local\pycharm\feedback_portal\admin\mini_conda_02.yml"
#     on ec2:
#         conda env create -f "/home/theld/code/git_repos/feedback_portal/admin/mini_conda_02.yml"
#
#         conda remove --yes --name mini_conda_02 --all
#         conda env create --yes -f "/home/theld/code/git_repos/feedback_portal/admin/mini_conda_02.yml" > conda_install.log 2>&1
#
# Updating the conda environment:
# ------------------------------
#   - Shell commands to update the conda virtual environment named "mini_conda_02"
#
#     conda activate mini_conda_02  (Warning! Make sure you don't skip this activation step)
#
#     on home computer:
#         conda env update --file "D:\local\cursor\feedback_portal\admin\mini_conda_02.yml" --prune
#     on work laptop:
#         conda env update --file "C:\tony_local\pycharm/feedback_portal\admin\mini_conda_02.yml"
#     on ec2:
#         conda env update --file "/home/theld/code/git_repos/feedback_portal/admin/mini_conda_02.yml"

# Notes:
# ------
#   - Make sure the name field below "name: mini_conda_02" matches the file name to avoid namespace issues
#
# Playwright Install Notes:
# ------
#   - After creating or updating this environment, on work/home machines run:
#         playwright install
#
# EC2 Playwright Installation Options (try in order, no admin required):
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Option 1: Use the automated script (recommended)
#   bash scripts/install_playwright_ec2.sh
#
# Option 2: Manual installation with specific versions
#   pip install playwright==1.25.4 pytest-playwright==0.2.0
#   playwright install
#
# Option 3: Try older Playwright version (more compatible)
#   pip install playwright==1.30.0 pytest-playwright==0.2.0
#   playwright install
#
# Option 4: Try individual browsers
#   playwright install firefox
#   playwright install webkit
#   playwright install chromium
#
# Note: Even if Playwright shows dependency warnings, it may still work.
# Test browser compatibility with: python tests/e2e/test_browser_compatibility.py
# If no browsers work, E2E tests will fail but unit/integration tests will work fine.
#
# If all options fail, the environment will still work for all other functionality.
# Only E2E tests will be affected - unit and integration tests will work normally.
