To determine the SQLAlchemy types and Python types from a model using inspect, you can use the sqlalchemy.inspection.inspect function. This function helps you inspect the model and retrieve the columns, along with their types.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

Example SQLAlchemy Model:
python
Copy code
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
Inspecting the Model:
You can use inspect to get information about the table's columns and types.

python
Copy code
from sqlalchemy.inspection import inspect

def get_column_info(model):
    # Get the table inspector for the model
    inspector = inspect(model)
    
    columns_info = {}
    for column in inspector.columns:
        col_name = column.name
        sqlalchemy_type = column.type
        python_type = column.type.python_type
        
        columns_info[col_name] = {
            'sqlalchemy_type': sqlalchemy_type,
            'python_type': python_type
        }
    
    return columns_info

# Example usage
column_info = get_column_info(User)
for col_name, col_types in column_info.items():
    print(f"Column: {col_name}, SQLAlchemy Type: {col_types['sqlalchemy_type']}, Python Type: {col_types['python_type']}")

Tables associated with incidences

emission_identified_flag
emission_type
incidence_qa_flag
inspection_flag
mitigation_type
sources

# this is a multiple foreign key association table (do this last)
plume_incidence_mapping



when we close, set the incidence end timestamp


python define a class in a function to avoid circular imports

def create_class():
    class MyClass:
        def __init__(self, value):
            self.value = value

        def do_something(self):
            print(f"Doing something with {self.value}")

    return MyClass

# Use the function to create the class
MyClass = create_class()

# Create an instance of the class
obj = MyClass(10)
obj.do_something()


Naming Conventions
---------------------
* pass an sql model as model_rows and iterate through it with for model_row in model_rows
* Use model_row if you have a single row from a query
* don't use form as a variable in html, it is confusing.  if you want to pass a WTForm, use the variable wtf_form

Datetime string conventions
---------------------------
- When you create an SQLAlchemy model, you can use a dict to represent the json column
- That dict can contain any python types, but if you try to write the json to the database, the type must serialize as a string
- datetimes coming into and out of the postgres database should follow the format "2024-09-03 16:55:00.000000"
      - logger.debug(f"Attempting to cast datetime to string")
      - value = datetime.datetime.strftime(value, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f")
      - if isinstance(obj, datetime):
          return obj.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f")
          value = datetime.datetime.strftime(value, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f")

Date-time issues
---------------------------
- if you set the raw_data for a date field you can get unexpected results!

- turned off editing the raw data
---------------------------------
- notes on an incidence created through the web-interface
    - seems to initialize and show dates properly
    - no validation data are presented (that may be by design, but it could be nice if it validated)
    - when you validate, the dates don't disappear and things sorta seem to work as desired
    - the creation process creates new instances each time you validate
- notes on GETing an incidence that already exists
    - date stamps are not in the right format and are deleted when you post
    - get does not show the validation errors (likely because i turned off raw data)
- notes on POSTing an incidence that already exists

- turned on editing the raw data
---------------------------------
- notes on an incidence created through the web-interface
    - GETing seems like things are populated properly, but there is no validation
    - When you post things seem to work as expected and get saved properly
- when you try and load, you get errors, likely because the json field has a string rather than a datetime object

currently datetimes are converted to at model_to_wtform to ensure they are datetime objects.
This works, but it means that datetimes in models may be strings or actual datetime objects depending on
if they were created as a python object or deserialized from the database or json file

secondary and tertiary causes are not mapping to their selects properly.
I think it is because the drop down does not have the same name as the element for the emission_cause and dropdown
+2024-11-15 14:29:32.350 | DEBUG    | portal_03.wtf_util | wtf_util.py | 579 | Initializing emission_cause.  field.data=-1

* trying to figure out the repeat incidence on validation for new incidences (fixed!)
    - testing creation through dummy data
        - on first get page, the database is not updated
        - if you validate, it creates an incidence
        - if you validate again, it creates another
    - options are to try and fix the existing structure (try first)
      or to get rid of the concept of creation pages (would get confusing on incidence id's being set automatically)


* It looks like validation is done on raw_data not the data, so if you try to run validation with GET
you get all sorts of errors because you are not setting the raw_data (which must be a string)

Monday fixes 11/19/24
  - change database location to dan's new db
    - old: satellite_tracker_sample2
    - new: satellite_tracker_demo1
  - change table with incidence info in column 'misc_json'
    - old: incidences_with_json
    - new: incidences
  - change table references to incidences not incidences_with_json
  - fix source id = none on the index page

Sunday prep priorities

* 11/17/24, deploying portal for dry-run purposes, clone will be on main branch that should be stable/working


*. double check o&g and landfill model validation (second pass)

Going to see if remote development is faster than developing off my laptop ...
initially looks like the remote is quite a lot faster at startup, but i don't think
the debugger is on, so i need to set some ec2 variables to make this a fair fight.

flask_logger.log replaced with portal_logger.log  changed to operator_portal.log that is not tracked by git

* db has entries for landfills (plural) should be changed to landfill for consistency
    (note that the names for sectors have changed, so this may be moot)

Getting ready to create a new feedback_portal pycharm repo because
it has becoming weird/unstable since i updated pycharm

how to run from command line:
(mini_conda_01) C:\one_drive\code\pycharm\feedback_portal\source\production\arb>flask --app wsgi run

folders marked as untracked:
    archive
    logs
    portal_uploads
    source/gpt_recommendations
    source/production/arb/logs
    source/tutorials

folders i have as source root
-------------------------------------------------------------------
source/production

folders i have marked as template - may need to set jinja as flask env
-------------------------------------------------------------------
source/production/arb/portal/templates

pycharm settings
-------------------------------------------------------------------
templating language: jinja2

getting git to work correctly
-------------------------------------------------------------------
go to settings version control directory mappings
remove any directories or projects, then add
C:\one_drive\code\pycharm\feedback_portal>

the shortcuts for one_drive are likely the source of the problem

git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Debug version 1.0.0. Stable before GPT refactor."
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Debug version 1.1.0. Stable after GPT refactor."
git tag -d v1.1.0


Possible starting point for best practices for archiving/versioning:

1. Include a RELEASE_NOTES.md file at the root of your file structure.  Example content of this file:

```
## v1.0.0 - 2025-04-28
- Feedback portal first stable release using ISD/ED approached spreadsheet feedback forms
- Current versions of feedback forms
  - energy_operator_feedback_v002.xlsx (Schema: energy_v00_01.json)
  - landfill_operator_feedback_v070.xlsx (Schema: landfill_v01_00.json)
  - oil_and_gas_operator_feedback_v070.xlsx (Schema: oil_and_gas_v01_00.json)
```

2. There are two options for including a version file at the root of your code, one is to have an __init__.py file with the line:
__version__ = "1.0.0".
The other option is to create a file named VERSION that is a plain text file with only one line of non-comments that includes the version number of your code.  For example "1.0.0"

3. Version Tagging in Git
Example git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Stable release v1.0.0 - ready for archive"
- Benefits include:
  - Built-in to Git
  - Easy to find later
  - Common practice (PyPI, GitHub, etc.)

4. Create an archive (.zip or .tar.gz)

- After tagging, you can create a snapshot from the command line.  For example:
  - git archive --format=zip --output=feedback_portal_v1.0.0.zip v1.0.0
- Benefits include:
  - Can store it offline, S3, external drive, etc.

chatgpt request template
----------------------------
I would like ***

1) app.py current has all the routes, please create a file named routes.py that has all routes associated with this project
2) in the routes file, use a blueprinting system where all the routes will use a newly created 'main' route
3) app.py should create a code factory app that is called in a separate wsgi file to make the app more portable.

Please refactor the following python code using the following style preferences:
1) use google formatting docstrings
2) use modern type hinting in the docstrings (not in the function definition).
3) docstring type hinting should be in the format:  variable_name (type_hint): variable description.
4) Include extensive documentation and examples.
5) Review all of the code and provide all suggestions in one response, not incrementally prompting me for additional information.
6) Include the full text for any file you create or propose to change.
7) Retain, all previous documentation, notes, and todos where possible
8) do not import typing, rather use modern type hinting such as the | symbol
9) do not omit any code for brevity, i'm going to copy paste your code into a new file.

Please create a new function named run_diagnostics that includes testing of key features of this file.
