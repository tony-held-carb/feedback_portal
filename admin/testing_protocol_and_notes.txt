Testing Protocol for Operator Portal Functionality

1. (Optional) Clear logs from:
        C:\one_drive\code\pycharm\feedback_portal\logs
        C:\one_drive\code\pycharm\feedback_portal\source\production\arb\logs

2. Launch portal
    from laptop:
        cd "C:\one_drive\code\pycharm\feedback_portal\source\production\arb"
        flask --app wsgi run --debug --no-reload
    from ec2:
        git checkout qa_qc_of_stable_system_01
        git fetch --all --prune
        git pull
        cd "/home/theld/code/git_repos/feedback_portal/shell_scripts"
        ./launch_with_screen.sh

3. Confirm logging file is created and logging as expected:
    from laptop:
        dir "C:\one_drive\code\pycharm\feedback_portal\source\production\arb\logs\"
    from ec2:
        cd "/home/theld/code/git_repos/feedback_portal/logs/"
        ls "/home/theld/code/git_repos/feedback_portal/logs/"
        head -n 2 arb_portal.log
        tail -n 2  arb_portal.log


4. Check that you can click all diagnostic menus and test search
    pass

5. Click the top 3 incidents in the index to make sure they work and that their summary data is populating properly
    pass

6. Create a new oil & gas incident
    - check to see if initial data population with dummy data makes sense
        created: id 1001
    - delete all data except the incidence id and validate
        pass
    - populate all fields with new values then validate
        pass
    - make sure all fields are persisting
        pass

7. Create a new landfill incident
    - check to see if initial data population with dummy data makes sense
        pass
    - delete all data except the incidence id and validate
        pass
    - populate all fields with new values then validate
        pass
    - make sure all fields are persisting
        pass

8. Create example templates for both oil and gas and landfill with all blank entries except for id_incident
    - drop these into the spreadsheet reader and make sure they populate persist
        - landfill
            pass
        - oil and gas
            pass

9. Create example templates for both oil and gas and landfill with all populated entries
    - drop these into the spreadsheet reader and make sure they populate persist
        - landfill
            pass
        - oil and gas
            pass

# todo - resume here for qa/qc
10. Use the excel jinja templates, that still have {{ variable }} notation and see what happens when you drop them in
    make sure to populate the id_incident or else it will make work for dan
    - drop these into the spreadsheet reader and make sure they populate persist
        - landfill
        - oil and gas

todo - Dropdowns are not all - Please Select, they are often defaulting to the first valid selection, which is confusing,
figure out why some are being coerced and others are not, come up with a general way to reset to 'Please Select' if
the input data are garbage?  It could be that this is not a reasonable test case as it is unlikely total garbage
would be allowed to be entered into the selector?  Maybe fix the other validations first?

It could turn out to be easy, just check and see if a value is in the choice list and make it None if it is not.
May need logic on how to cascade down from the first to the last question, could already sorta be there and you
just need to validate selectors in the order of how contingent selectors are updated.

I made a fix, just gotta test it and make sure I did not break anything


11. Create example templates for both oil and gas and landfill with deliberately incorrect data types
    - Date fields
        use incorrectly formated date strings
        put in words rather than date information
    - Number fields
        put in blank strings and/or words
    - drop these into the spreadsheet reader and make sure they populate persist and log failure warnings

12.  Oil and Gas Validation
    - Make sure any contingent drop downs are working as expected
    - Make a list of all logic rules and make sure each is enforced

13.  Landfill Validation
    - Make sure any contingent drop downs are working as expected
    - Make a list of all logic rules and make sure each is enforced
