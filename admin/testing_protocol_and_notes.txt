Testing Protocol for Operator Portal Functionality

1. (Optional) Clear logs from:
        C:\one_drive\code\pycharm\feedback_portal\logs
        C:\one_drive\code\pycharm\feedback_portal\source\production\arb\logs

2. Launch portal
    from laptop:
        cd "C:\one_drive\code\pycharm\feedback_portal\source\production\arb"
        flask --app wsgi run --debug --no-reload
    from ec2:
        git fetch --all --prune
        git checkout your_branch
        cd "/home/theld/code/git_repos/feedback_portal/shell_scripts"
        ./launch_with_screen.sh

3. Confirm logging file is created and logging as expected:
    from laptop:
        dir "C:\one_drive\code\pycharm\feedback_portal\source\production\arb\logs\"
    from ec2:
        cd "/home/theld/code/git_repos/feedback_portal/logs/"
        head arb_portal.log
        tail arb_portal.log


4. Check that you can click all diagnostic menus

5. Click the top 3 incidents in the index to make sure they work and that their summary data is populating properly

6. Create a new oil & gas incident
    - check to see if initial data population with dummy data makes sense
    - delete all data except the incidence id and validate
    - populate all fields with new values then validate
    - make sure all fields are persisting

7. Create a new landfill incident
    - check to see if initial data population with dummy data makes sense
    - delete all data except the incidence id and validate
    - populate all fields with new values then validate
    - make sure all fields are persisting

8. Create example templates for both oil and gas and landfill with all blank entries except for id_incident
    - drop these into the spreadsheet reader and make sure they populate persist

9. Create example templates for both oil and gas and landfill with all populated entries
    - drop these into the spreadsheet reader and make sure they populate persist

10. Create example templates for both oil and gas and landfill with deliberately incorrect data types
    - Date fields
        use incorrectly formated date strings
        put in words rather than date information
    - Number fields
        put in blank strings and/or words
    - drop these into the spreadsheet reader and make sure they populate persist and log failure warnings

11.  Oil and Gas Validation
    - Make sure any contingent drop downs are working as expected
    - Make a list of all logic rules and make sure each is enforced

12.  Landfill Validation
    - Make sure any contingent drop downs are working as expected
    - Make a list of all logic rules and make sure each is enforced
