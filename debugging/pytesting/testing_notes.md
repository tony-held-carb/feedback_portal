- updated e2e last night to make it more robust
- running tests on home, work, ec2 using demo database and saving to tests_02
- looks like most are passing, maybe a few minor testing issues
- going to decide to fix the testing or switch to testing on the real database and just make notes on the fails
- would like to change the waiting system so that it was more robust, but that may be a future fix
