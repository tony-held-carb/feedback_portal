FIRST PASS TESTING SUMMARY
==========================

This document summarizes the results of first pass testing for all previously skipped files.
The approach was to test what can be tested with minimal context and skip complex context-dependent features.

TEST RESULTS BY CATEGORY
========================

1. WTForms Files (3 files)
--------------------------
- test_wtf_landfill.py: 3 passed, 5 skipped
- test_wtf_oil_and_gas.py: 5 passed, 5 skipped  
- test_wtf_upload.py: 3 passed, 3 skipped
TOTAL: 11 passed, 13 skipped

2. Startup Files (2 files)
--------------------------
- test_startup_flask.py: 5 passed, 2 skipped
- test_startup_runtime_info.py: 4 passed, 2 skipped
TOTAL: 9 passed, 4 skipped

3. Utils Files (6 files)
------------------------
- test_utils_db_ingest_util.py: 6 passed, 3 skipped
- test_utils_db_introspection_util.py: 1 passed, 1 skipped
- test_utils_file_upload_util.py: 1 passed, 1 skipped
- test_utils_form_mapper.py: 1 passed, 1 skipped
- test_utils_route_util.py: 4 passed, 2 skipped
- test_utils_sector_util.py: 1 passed, 1 skipped
TOTAL: 14 passed, 9 skipped

OVERALL SUMMARY
===============
- Total files tested: 11
- Total tests: 60
- Tests passed: 34 (57%)
- Tests skipped: 26 (43%)
- Files with at least some coverage: 11/11 (100%)

WHAT WAS TESTED
===============
- Form instantiation and field presence (WTForms)
- Function signatures and basic structure (Utils)
- Configuration application (Startup)
- Platform detection and path structure (Runtime Info)
- Flask app configuration (Startup Flask)

WHAT WAS SKIPPED
================
- Complex Flask request context requirements
- Database operations requiring SQLAlchemy setup
- File system operations requiring test files
- Form validation requiring form data
- Runtime diagnostics requiring logging capture

NEXT STEPS
==========
- Update documentation to reflect new "Easily Testable Items Fully Covered - Follow Up Context Testing Required" status
- These files are now ready for follow-up context-dependent testing when test infrastructure improves
- All limitations are clearly documented with skip reasons

This represents significant progress in test coverage while maintaining transparency about limitations.
